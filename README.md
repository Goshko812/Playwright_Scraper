# Playwright_Scraper
Playwright scraper and crawler

# Versions and Differences

**BFS version**
The BFS version uses the Breadth-First Search Approach
To ensure the crawler explores all pages more thoroughly the crawler processes all immediate links (siblings) at the current depth level before moving on to deeper levels.

**Scrape Everything**
This pretty much lets the crawler to go wild (can't recommend)

**Scrape Domain Scope only**
Scrapes within the domain scope (worse BFS version as this goes in a straight line and doesn't scan everything)
